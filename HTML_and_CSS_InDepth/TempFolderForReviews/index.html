                        Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared
                        dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy.
                        Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to
                        incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
